# Writing Natural-Sounding Call Messages

This guide will help you write messages that sound more human and natural when spoken by AI voices.

## 🎯 Key Principles for Natural Speech

### 1. **Use Conversational Language**
❌ **Bad**: "Attention. This is reminder. Appointment tomorrow."
✅ **Good**: "Hi there! Just wanted to remind you about your appointment tomorrow."

### 2. **Add Punctuation for Natural Pauses**
The system automatically adds pauses based on punctuation:
- **Period (.)** → 500ms pause
- **Comma (,)** → 250ms pause  
- **Question mark (?) or Exclamation (!)** → 500ms pause
- **Colon (:)** → 300ms pause

Example:
```
Hi! This is Sarah from ABC Clinic. I'm calling to confirm your appointment 
tomorrow, March 18th, at 3 PM. If you need to reschedule, please give us 
a call back. Thanks, and have a great day!
```

### 3. **Write How You Speak**
Think about how you would actually say it in person:
- Use contractions: "I'm", "you're", "we'll" instead of "I am", "you are", "we will"
- Add friendly words: "Hi!", "Thanks", "Great", "Please"
- Keep sentences shorter (15-20 words max)

### 4. **Add Emphasis Where Needed**
Use natural emphasis words:
- "Really appreciate it"
- "Very important"
- "Absolutely love to hear from you"

4. **Use Numbers Naturally**: Write "three PM" instead of "3 PM" for better pronunciation

4. ❌ Too long: One continuous sentence with no breaks
   ✅ Broken up: Multiple shorter sentences with natural breaks

5. ❌ No greeting: Jumping straight to the message
   ✅ With greeting: Starting with "Hello!" or "Hi there!"
